Game Journal Project
-----------------------------
Description: A web where a user can add new games they like and record journal entries of
	their last play session. Often times I play a game I really like but do not have a time
	to finish it, so I put it down for several days to weeks and forget where I was or
	what I was doing. The purpose of this app is to create log of the last thing I did
	in the game and can refresh my memory before jumping into a new play session.

Stack: Java Spring Boot
